Follow the instructions below to get a functioning whois-lookup service on your website in a couple of minutes.

Download the files (in .zip format) from the downloads page.
If you're reading this, then you've probably already done that.

You will need winzip or an equivalent program to unpack the archive. 
Unzip the files on your computer. Now.

This should create a folder "samswhoisdistribution" containing a few other files and the samswhois folder.

Read the file "license.txt" and make sure you agree with everything in it. Please :)

Upload the files in "samswhoisdistribution" to the document root of your web server
(the folder accessed by http://www.yoursite.com/). 
*NOTE* - don't upload the "samswhoisdistribution" folder itself. Just the files and folder inside it.

You also don't need to upload the "license.txt" and "install.txt" (this one) files. No real harm if you do though.

If you want to use the caching options, set the permissions on the "/samswhois/cache" folder (on your server) 
so that the script can create files in it. 

Point your web browser to http://www.yoursite.com/whois-example.php 

Congratulations! You should now have a fully functioning whois-lookup on your website.

To customize it to your website's look and feel, modify the whois-example.php file with your own html.

You can quickly alter the design of the form and results by editing the css styles in the file swstyles.css.

The whois-example.php file contains a lot of comments describing how to set various options in the script.

For further information, see the online docs at http://www.phpace.com/scripts/sams-whois/ for general usage, 
editing the css styles, and using the SamsWhois class directly.

Any problems? Submit them at http://www.phpace.com/scripts/sams-whois/

Thanks for using Sams Whois!

Cheers, Sam Yapp
